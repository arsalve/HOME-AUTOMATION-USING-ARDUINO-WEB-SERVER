# HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-ARDUINO-WEB-SERVER
  The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board with Ethernet shield being remotely controlled by any smart phone which have Wi-Fi. As technology is advancing so houses are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches. Presently, conventional wall switches located in different parts of the house makes it difficult for the user to go near them to operate. Even more it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. Remote controlled home automation system provides a most modern solution with smart phones, computers
 
# HOW DOES IT WORK?
 The main brain for this project is Arduino Uno board along with Arduino Ethernet shield to give it a wireless connectivity. Arduino runs a code to control a relay board according to the input and also serves a web page through which respective output to the relay board can be controlled. Through relay (a relay is an electrically operated switch.) Controller board we can control lamps, tubes or any ac power sockets.  You will be able to control all of your ac appliances wirelessly with the help of any device.
